    <h1>Using the document.write() method and how it works on a page.</h1>

    <p>With the document.write method, I learnt today that it is used for testing purposes in your code to check how the code will run. It should be used cautiously because if you use it after the page loads, it will erase all the previous data and display only what is written in it. It is therefore advisable to always use it after the page has finished loading.</p>

    <h2>Let's give it a try and see how it works.</h2>

    <button onclick = "document.write('This is a test to how the document.write\()\ method works in a program.')">Try it</button>

    <h3>Observe carefully that when you click on the button you will see that all the content that were displayed formally will disappear because of the behaviour of the document.write method when it runs after the page has finished loading</h3>

    <p><b>Keep in mind always that with the document.write method it should only be used for testing and when carefull analysis is not made you will mistaken erase all your data in your code and be like how, why has all my data erased...this is because of the behaviour of the document.write method. Well done!</b></p>
